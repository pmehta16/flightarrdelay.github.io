                </h2>
                <p>Our project aims at predicting the arrival delay of flight using only information available before 
                    the flight takes off. The target variable (ArrDelay - arrival delay) is a numerical value we 
                    will use regression algorithms only. We will be analyzing a big data set and for such amount of
                    data we need big data tools such as Spark. Spark can store big datasets in cluster memory with
                    paging from disk as required and effectively runs machine learning algorithms without
                    having to sync multiple times to the disk, making them run faster.

                </h2>
                <p color = "Black">Air travel is the most preferred way to travel. By 2030, more than 45000 connections will be observed per day on an average metro airport.<br>
                     This makes it important to study the feasibility of taking a flight. For example:- If a flight from Charlotte to Atlanta takes an average time of <br>
                     1 hour 18 minutes. But the flight is generally delayed by 20 minutes on average. This could make it impractical for someone as we have to reach the <br> 
                     airport 1 hour in advance, and also travel time to the airport adds up. Whereas, the same distance can be covered by car in equivalent time. <br>
                     Hence, Understanding the delay of any particular airline at any given airport is important. This can also be used as a feedback mechanism for <br>
                     airlines to make sure that the flight is not delayed. Our model will focus on predicting the delay in flights.

                    from 2018. Size of dataset used - 893 MB. It consists of 7213446 rows and 28 columns. To study the data and relationship between the <br>
                    columns we did a correlation analysis on the dataset to fetch the important set of features. After analysing the data we dropped these columns - <br><br>

                </h2>
                <h5>Frameworks</h5>
                <p color = "Black">We have implemented the algorithm using the Pyspark framework. Execution of code was done on the DSBA Hadoop cluster. <br>
                    Along with Pyspark we have used numpy and pandas libraries to perform operations on the data. For Data Processing we have used OnehotEncoder library. <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Techniques -</h5>
<pre>
<b>1.) Data Analysis</b>
    Firstly, to analyse the problem and dataset we did an exploratory data analysis. Since most variables are numerical we created a correlation
    matrix, of the numerical variables, to understand if we can find any correlation between the attributes.  The closer the value is to 1 or -1, 
    the more positively or negatively the variables are correlated. A correlation of zero means that the two attributes are not correlated at all.
    Looking at the correlation matrix we concluded that the DepDelay (departure delay) is highly correlated to arrival delay, so the departure 
    delay might be the most indicative attribute of a flight delay. Also, although weak, there exists a correlation between the TaxiOut and arrival
    delay. Therefore we will consider these two as well.

<b>2.) Cleaning the data</b>
    We used the .drop() function to drop all the columns that were concerned with the details after the flight took off and also columns that 
    were too correlated between themselves and could be redundant to the model causing the model to overfit. We also dropped cancelled flights and 
    variables that were not correlated to the arrival delay.
 
<b>3.) Data Processing</b>
    To use the categorical variables in the regression algorithm, further processing was needed. The variables were converted to numerical values by 
    applying OneHotEncoder. Data after performing OneHot encoding -

    <br>
    <img src = "img/ohe_2.png">
    <br>
<b>3.) Training the model</b>
    We found that variables - departure delay and arrival delay displayed a high correlation and so were used for performing Linear Regression. We split
    the data into train and test sets in the ratio 80:20. We performed the linear regression following these steps - converting the categorical values (if
    it applies) to numerical ones, then assembling all in a features vector and running the machine learning algorithm to obtain a model.
